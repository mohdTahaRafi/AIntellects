AIntellects 
This repository contains a project that demonstrates the integration of Machine Learning (ML) models with a database (DB). The goal is to showcase how ML models can be trained, stored, and retrieved from a database for inference or further analysis. Additionally, this project includes a frontend interface to interact with the ML model and database.

Project Overview
The ML to DB Integration project focuses on:

Training a Machine Learning model using a dataset.

Storing the trained model in a database.

Retrieving the model from the database for inference or further use.

Demonstrating end-to-end workflow from data preprocessing to model deployment.

Providing a frontend interface for users to interact with the ML model and database.

This project is designed to help developers understand how to bridge the gap between Machine Learning and database systems, enabling efficient storage and retrieval of ML models, and providing a user-friendly interface.

Setup Instructions
To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/mohdTahaRafi/AIntellects.git
cd AIntellects/ML_to_DB
Install Python Dependencies:
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the required libraries:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set Up the Database:

This project uses SQLite for simplicity. The database will be created automatically when you run the scripts.

If you prefer to use another database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL), update the db_operations.py script with the appropriate connection details.

Run the Scripts:

Data Preprocessing:

bash
Copy
python scripts/data_preprocessing.py
Train the Model:

bash
Copy
python scripts/train_model.py
Store the Model in DB:

bash
Copy
python scripts/db_operations.py --action save
Retrieve the Model for Inference:

bash
Copy
python scripts/db_operations.py --action load
python scripts/inference.py
Frontend Setup
The frontend is built using React. Follow these steps to set up and run the frontend:

Navigate to the Frontend Directory:

bash
Copy
cd frontend
Install Node.js and npm:
Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. You can download them from https://nodejs.org/.

Install Frontend Dependencies:
Run the following commands to install all required dependencies for the frontend:

bash
Copy
# Core React dependencies
npm install react react-dom react-router-dom

# Material-UI dependencies
npm install @mui/material @mui/icons-material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
npm install @mui/x-charts
npm install styled-components

# Animation and Effects
npm install aos
npm install typewriter-effect

# Carousel/Slider
npm install react-slick slick-carousel

# Development dependencies
npm install -D @vitejs/plugin-react
npm install -D vite
npm install -D @eslint/js eslint eslint-plugin-react eslint-plugin-react-hooks eslint-plugin-react-refresh globals
Run the Frontend Development Server:

bash
Copy
npm start
This will start the development server and open the frontend in your default browser at http://localhost:3000.

Connect Frontend to Backend:

Ensure the backend server is running.

Update the API endpoints in the frontend code (src/App.js or similar) to match the backend server URL.

Usage
Data Preprocessing:

The data_preprocessing.py script cleans and prepares the dataset for training.

Model Training:

The train_model.py script trains a Machine Learning model using the preprocessed data and saves it locally.

Database Operations:

The db_operations.py script handles saving and loading the model to/from the database.

Inference:

The inference.py script demonstrates how to load the model from the database and use it for predictions.

Frontend Interface:

Use the frontend interface to interact with the ML model and database. The interface allows users to input data, view predictions, and manage the database.
